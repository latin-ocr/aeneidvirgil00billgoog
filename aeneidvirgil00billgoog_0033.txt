What wrong can my Aeneas or Troy‘s sons

Have done thee, that to them, so scourged by Death,

For Italy's sole sake, all lands are barred?

Firm was thy promise, Sire, that circling years

From Troy’s replenished blood at last should raise 235
Romans, commanders, ruling sea and land ,

With sway imperial. What hath changed thy plan l
That pledge consoled me, weighing Doom with Doom‚
For Troy's sad ruin ; yet a woe not less

Still dogs the suffering heroes: OSupreme l 240
Where wilt thou place the limit of their pain l

Antenor, scaping through the Achaean hosts,

Might thread Illyrian bays, and make unharmed

Remote Liburnia and Timavus’ fount,

Where through nine mouths, out of the roarin rock, Ι
Spouts the loud sea, and drowns the furrowed held.

Yet there he built Patavium, gave a home,

A name to Trojans‚ hung up arms of Troy,

And now in happy quiet slumbers well.

But we, thy seed, to whom high Heaven thou giv‘st,

Our ships all lost, for one heart’s spite betrayed,

Far from Italian shores are sundered still.

Is this faith’s meedl Is this our crown restored l ‘’

On her the Sire of Men and Gods looked down,
Smiling as when he calms the fretful sky ;
He gently kissed his daughter's lips, and said:
“ Fear not, sweet Venus! Know‚ thy people’s doom
Stands changeless: thou shalt see thy promised town,
Lavinium's walls, and bear to Heaven sublime

Great·souled Aeneas. N ought hath changed my plan.
Know‚—since this trouble gnaws thee, Ι will speak
More fully, and unroll the leaves of Fate,—

Long shall he fight in Italy, subdue

Fierce tribes, and in wall'd cities school his men,
