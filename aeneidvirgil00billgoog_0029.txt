Of shimmering woodland, crowned by forest gloom.
Under the fronting bluff, a·rock·hung cave,
With seats of living stone, and waters sweet,

’ Α Sea-Nymphs’ home3 where the wave·weary bark
Needs not the cable, nor the anchor's tooth.
Here, with seven ships, the relies of his fleet,
Aeneas steers, and TrojanS, sick for land,
Leap out at last, and gain the dreamed·of shore,
And on the sand their briny limbs repose.
And first from fiint Achates struck a spark,
And caught in leaves, and with dry timber nursed 17 ς

To bake and bray with stones their rescued meal.

Meanwhile Aeneas climbs a rock‚ and scans
All the wide sea, to spy, if spy he may,
Antheus storm-toss'd, or Capys, or the arms
High on Caicus' stern, or Phrygian sloops.
No ships in sight, but roaming on the land
Three stags he saw ; behind thern all the decr,
1n one long file, go browsing down the dales.
He paused; he seized the bow and 'flying shafts
Which leal Achates bore, and first laid low
The leaders of the herd, who proud bore up
Their branching heads, then aimed the crowd entire,
And drove into the glens their broken ranks;
Nor stayed, till seven huge bodies on the ground,-
To match his tale of ships-the Victor stretched.
Who sought the haven, and divided all,
And shared the wine, which on Trinacria’s beach
Acestes gave, a hero’s parting boon,
Then thus with words their languish’d hearts consoled:
