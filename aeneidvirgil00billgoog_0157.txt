Tarentum's bay, once home, if fame not errs,

Of Hercules, Lacinia’s answering fane,

And Caulon‘s cliffs, and Scylaceum's strand,

Wreck-strewn. Then Aetna rises from the wave;

And far away we hear the loud sea moan 555
On beaten crags, and the shore’s broken voice.

The surf leaps high; the sands and surges mix.

Then spake Anchises: ‘’Tis Charybdis, sure,

Those rocks, those awful crags the Seer foretold l “

Make off, my friends, rise on the oars in time! ’ 560
They straight obey; and Palinurus first

Swings South the roaring prow‚ and all our host

With oar, with wind, strain South. Now up to heaven
The arched wave lifts us; now, the wave drawn in,

We sink to shades below. Thrice roar the rocks 565
Through caverns deep ;.thrice the showered spray we see,
And stars bedewed with brine. But now the wind

Sinks with the sun, and leaves us weary men,

Who float unknowing to the Cyclops’ coast.

“ A haven wide there lies, by beating winds 570
Unstirred, but near it Aetna thundering vents
Terrific deiuge. Now a cloud of smoke,
Whirlwinds of pitch‚ and embers glowing white,
To the frayed stars he flings, and globes of fire.
Now shattered stones and entrails of the mount 575
He belches forth, and volleys molten rocks,
Roaring, and boiling srom his deep abyss.
Below that mass, Enceladus, 'tis famed, ¹
Lies, scorehed by lightning, while above his head
Through riven ducts great Aetna blows his flames. 580
And all Trinacria, when he turns his side,
Trembles and moans, and shrouds in smoke the sky.
That night those uncouth wonders we endure,
Hidden in woods, nor see what makes the din.
