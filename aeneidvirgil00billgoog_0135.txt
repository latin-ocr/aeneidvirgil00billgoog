Then overhead a blue-black cloud of rain

Bore night and storm ; the shuddering water gloomed. 19 5
Blasts rolled the sea ; the mountain billows rose,

And scattered wide our ships: the rainy clouds

Shronded the day, 3ηά hid the darkened sky,

While fire flashed frequent from the riven rack. ,

Swept from our course, we drift on blinding surge. 200
E'en Palinurus in the sky confounds

N oontide with night, nor recollects his course.

Three days we drift in doubt and blinding gloom,

Rose the fourth morn, disclosing distant hills 20 ς
And curling smoke. Down drop the sails; on oars

Rising, our mariners with no delay

Lustily toss the foam, and sweep the blue.

“Saved from the deep, isles of the Ionian main
Receive me first, by Greeks named Strophades, 210

Not any deadlier plague and wrath of Heaven,
Rose from the Stygian flood. Winged things, they wear 215
Girls’ faces ; foul the droppings of their vent ;
Claws are their hands ; their features evermore

With famine pale.

“ Borne thither, and the haven made, behold l
Rich droves of cattle scattered o’er the leas, 330
Αηά flocks of goats untended we descry.
We flesh our blades, and Jove himself invite
To share with Gods our spoil, then by the hay,
Pile grassy seats, and feast on goodly cheer.
But sudden from the cliffs, with awful swoop, 22 ς
Those Harpies fall, and flap their clangorons wings,
