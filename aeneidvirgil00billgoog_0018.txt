(ἰ A Doom-led exile, on Lavinian shores

'Q By I-Ieaven's rude arm, through Juno‘s brooding ire,
And war-worn long ere building for his Gods 5
A Home in Latium : whence the Latin race,
The Lords of Alba, and high-towering Rome.

   

χ Reached Italy ; long tossed on sea and land

Tell, Muse, the cause ζ how pained, how foiled in Will,
The Queen of Gods drove one whom Virtue crowned
Such toils to approach, and compass all that woe. 10
can Heavenly hearts so unreleqting prove?

An ancient town, by Tyrian settlers held,
Far off faced Italy and Tiber mouth,
Carthage, well-dowered, and schooled in roughest war.
Before all lands, rnen say, ’twas Juno’s haunt, 1 5
Before e’en Samos. There her chariot stood;
There hung her arms ; there, if no Fates forbade,
She planned e’en then and nursed a world-wide Throne.
But fame had reached her that a race was sprung
From Trojan blood, her Tyrian towers to strew ; 20
From whom a sovran People, proud in arms,
Should come to Lib a's bane ; so rolled the Doom.
Fraught with h ear, and that remembered feud
Once for dear rgos she had waged at Troy ς-
Though still the smart rema-ined, still deep at hart 2 5
Saturnia nursed the Judgment Paris gave,
Her beauty's eruel slight, the race abhorred,
The honours paid to Heaven-rapt Ganymede ;—
Thus more inflamed, from Latium far she kept,
Tossed o’er all ννένεε, the Trojans left by Greeks, 30
Achilles‘ lea'vings‚ and for many a §ear
From sea to sea they wandered, pushed by Fate:
Such work} was wrought to build the Roman Race 1
