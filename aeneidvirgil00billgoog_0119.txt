“Again Ι pass to Priam' s towered seat.
In the void cloisters, Juno's sanctuary‚
Phoenix and dire Ulysses‚ chosen guards‚
Watch' oer the spoil. There Trojan treasures, torn
From blazing shrines, and tables of the Gods,
Bowls of pure gold, arrd captive vestments lie 765
Promiscuous heaped. Around‚ in long array,
Stand boys and trembling mothers.

“ Nay more: I dared to pierce the night-with eries,
Filling the streets with noise ; and vainly again, '
Again redoubling, called Creusa’s name. 77o

hus storming as 1 ranged, in ceaseless quest,

Phantom sad, mine own Creusa's Shade,

Rose to my sight, greater than her I knew. .
θροΠ- ·‚bound my hair uprose‚ my tongue was tled.
She spake, and with these words dispelled my care: 775

“ ‘Why wilt thou yield thee to such frenzied woe,
Sweet Husband? Not without the Will of Gods
It happens thus. To bear me hence with thee
Fate not permits thee, nor Olympus' Lord
Long exile shall be thine‚ vast seas to plough, 780
And thou shalt reach Hesperia, where by tilth ²
And wealth of men smooth- -sliding Tiber flows. ζ
There Joy and kingship and a royal wife '
Are thine. For dear Creusa weep no more.

1 shall not see the Myrmidons‘ proud seats, 78 5 ·
Nor go to dwell a slave for Grecian wives, ³
l of the Dardans, wife of Venus' son Ι

Nay3 me the mrghty Mother of the Gods ··.
Here keeps. Farewell. ¹ Love still thy son and nune ¹

‘Thus when she had said, rnto thin arr diffused, 790
She left me weeping, fain to tell her much.
