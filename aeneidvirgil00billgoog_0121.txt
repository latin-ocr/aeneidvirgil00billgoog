Thrice round her neck I tried to throw my arms :
Thrice fled the Vision from my empty grasp‚
As light as wind, and like a flying dream3

“So night was spent, and I rejoined my friends ; 795
And wondering there a mighty host I find ’
Of comrades streaming fresh, mothers and men
F or exile thronged, a piteous group‚ who met
From every quarter, ready to embark
Their hearts and fortunes for what lands I chose. . 800

“And now the Day Star rose o’er Ida's erest,
Leading the morn ; and still the Danaans held
The leaguered gates: no hope of help was given.
1 turned ; Ι raised my sire, and sought the hills.'’
