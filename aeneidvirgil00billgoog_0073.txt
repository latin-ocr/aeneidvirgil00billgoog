Some at that fatal gift to Pallas gape,

Amazed at the vast Horse And loudest cried .
Thymoetes, ‘Draw rt inward, to the Keep ¹
Traitorous, or so Troy s Doom already swayed. ,
But Capys, and the men of wiser wit, 35 ’
Charged them to fling in sea that Danaan snare,
Suspicious gift, and burn it over flames,

Or bore and probe the hollow haunts within:
Contrary wishes rend the uncertain crowd.

“But foremost there, with a large concourse round, 40

Down from the Keep Laocoon runs hot,

Calling,‘ Ο Burghers! What sad frenzy rs this?

Think ye our foes are fled, or that one gift

Of Greeks rs guileless? Is rt thus ye know

Ulysses? In this frame lie Argives hid,

Or else this engine for our walls rs built,

To spy our homes, and stornr us from above.

Some fraud is there ! Ο never trust the Horse!

Though Greeks bear offeriffgs‘siear ''their'i‘s'tffl l’

“So saying, with great force his mighty spear 50
Against the flanks and belly of the beast
He hurled: it stood and quivered: at the rmpact
The cavern groaned3 and had not Heaven's decree,
Had not our hearts been froward, on his charge

We had wrecked thandYQssr and thou, O Troy! 55
O Towers of Priam 1 ye were standing now. Ι

“But lo! the while with uproar to their King
Some Dardan hinds were dragging one fast bound
With hands behind him, who, unknown to thern,
Himself had given to work this very deed, 60
And open Troy to Greeks, one stout of heart,
Doubly prepared, to trick us or to die.
