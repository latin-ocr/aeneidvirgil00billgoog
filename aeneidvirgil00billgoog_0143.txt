Bidden to die! who bore no lottery’s shame‚

N or captive pressed a conquering master’s bed l

We, from our burning town borne oversea,

The pride and insults of Achilles’ son

Endured, and the slave’s child-bed. Wooing then

Leda's Hermione, the Spartan bride,

To Helenus he passed me, thrall to thrall.

But him Orestes, burning with great love 330
For his rapt bride, and by Crime’s Furies driven,

Took unawares, and at his altars slew.

At Pyrrhus' death, part of his kingdom fell

To Helenus, who named the land entire

Chaonia, after Trojan Chaon’s name, 33 ς
And built this towered Ilian citadel.

“ ‘ But thee what wind, what fate hath driven l What God
Thrust thee unweeting on our coast? How fares
Ascanius? Drinks he yet the living air,
Whom once in Troy- 340
Doth the boy pine for his lost mother still?
Is he to ancient valour by his sire
Aeneas, by his uncle Hector roused ?'

“She ended weeping, and long sobbed in vain ;
When from the town the hero Helenus 345
Came, thronged with friends, and recognised his kin,
And gladly led us in, and at each word
Shed many a tear. Ι go, and round me see
A lesser Troy, dwarf towers like her great,
A dried-up stream named Xanthus, and embrace 3 50
A Scaean Gate. My Trojans too the while
Enjoy the friendly city ; them the King

Welcomes in spacious cloisters, and they pour
In the Hall’s centre votive cups of wine,
And feast on golden plats, and lift the bowl. 3 5 5
