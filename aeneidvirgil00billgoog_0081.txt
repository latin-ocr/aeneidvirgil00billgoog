’Tis right to break the oaths I sware to Greeks,
Right to abhor those men, and spread abroad
Whate'er they hide: nor do my country's laws
Bind me. But thou, keep saith, thy saviour save,
If speaking truth, O Troy ! I well repay.

“ ‘All hope, all heart the Greeks had in their war
Stood still on Pallas’ aid ; but since unjust
Tydides and Ulysses, rich in crimes,
From Pallas’ holy fane her fateful Sign
Adventuring to tear, the sentries slew,
Seized the pure image, and with bloody palms
Dared touch her maiden chaplets,-since that day
The hopes of Greece ebbed refluent, her strength
Broke, and the Goddess turned her heart away.
No doubtful portents showed Tritonia wroth.
The Statue scarce in camp, a blaze of fire
Flashed from her lifted eyes, and 0'er her limbs
Ran a salt sweat, and thrice, Ο wondrous tale!
With shield and shivering spear from earth she leapt !
. “ F ly !'' Calchas cried‚ “ F ly back across the main 1
Troy cannot fall, unless again you seek
In Greece new omens, and bring back the grace
Which once was seated on your seaward keels !''
So now they run toward Argos on the wind
For arms and Gods3 and soon remeasuring sea,
Will front you unawares. So taught the Seer:
And on his charge this image they have built
For outraged Pallas, to atone their sin.
This mass immeasurable he bade them rear
With oaken beams, and build it up to heaven,
So that it might not pass within your gates,
And under old religion succour Troy. .
For if your hand profaned the Goddess' gift,
Ruin and death, he said,-God sooner turn
