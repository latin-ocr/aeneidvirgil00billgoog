Loud cry the straining mariners, ‘To Crete ! '
Cheerly they urge, ‘ On to our fathers’ home !‘
A wind that follows wafts us on our way,

And to those ancient shores we glide at last.

“My long-craved walls Ι trace, and call the town
Pergameo, praying Trojans, who rejoice
In that great name, to love the towers they raise.
And now our vessels on the beach were drawn, 135
And all on marriage bent, and tillage new ς
Laws, homes I gave ; when from the tainted sky
On human limbs a sudden sickness fell,
A blight on trees and crops, a year of death.
Sweet life they left, or dragged enfcebled frames, 140 '
While Sirius seared the fields, the herbage died, ’
Sick crops refused their yield. My father then
Bade us remeasure sea, and reach once more
Ortygia, and implore of Phoebus' grace

When pain should end, and whence he bade us try 145
Our weariness to heal, and whither steer.

“ 'Twas night, and sleep held all the living world.
The Holy Shapes, the Phrygian Gods of Home,
Whom with me l had borne from Troy and flames,
Seemed in my sleep to stand belore mine eyes, 150
Revealed in streaming light, where the full moon
Poured through the deep-set windows ε who thus spake,
Dispelling care. ‘What Phoebus hath to say,
When thou hast reached Ortygia, here he sounds.
He sends us to thy door. When Troy was burned, 155
We followed thee and thine, measured in ships
The tumbling waves with thee ; we too will raise
Thy children to the stars, and give thy town
Empire. Thy walls build greatly for the great.
Nor shun long pain and exile. Thou must rest 160
