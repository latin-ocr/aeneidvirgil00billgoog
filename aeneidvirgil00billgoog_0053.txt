Theo, casting down her looks, Dido in brief:

“ Put off your anxious fears. To use these means,
And guard my frontiers well, my hard estate
Compels me, and the newness of my realrn.

Who knows not Troy, and good Aeneas’ racc i
Their feats, their men, and that great flame of War?
Our hearts are not so dull ; from Tyrian town

The Sun his horses yokes not so remote.

Whether Hesperia, Satum’s land, ye choose,

Or Eryx’ country and Acestes King,

Safe 1 will send you, and with stores assist.

Or will you stay, this realm with me to share?

’Tis yours, this city Ι build. Here beach your ships.
Trojans and Tyrians‚-I shall dcem them one.

Ah l that your King were here himself, compell'd
By that same gale, Aeneas ! Up the coast

Sure spies will 1 dispatch to Libya’s ends,

Lest outcast he in town or forest stray.”

Roused by these words, long since Achates bold,
And Prince Aeneas were on fire to break
The shrouding mist. And first Achates urged:
“Q Goddess-born l What purpose stirs thee now i
Thou see’st aiss'a‘fe, our ships, our friends restored,
Save one, whom in mid sea ourselves beheld
Drowned, to thy mother’s words all else responds.”
He scarce had spoken, when the veiling cloud
Parts suddenly, and melts into the air.
Aeneas stood revealed in radiant day ;
In face and shoulders God-like, for on him
His mother shed the rosy light of Youth,
Fair tresses, and the charm of happy eyes,
As when man’s hand adds grace to ivory,
Or Parian marbles are encinct with gold.
