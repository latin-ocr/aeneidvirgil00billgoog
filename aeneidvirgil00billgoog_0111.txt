My father, whom I first desired to bear 6 3 5
High up the hills, and whom Ι first approached‚

Refused, since Troy was shattered, to prolong

His days in exile. ‘Ye, O ye whose blood

Runs fresh,’ he cried‚ ‘in your own vigour strong,

Turn ye to flight l 640
If the high Gods had willed that Ι should live,

They would have spared my home. Enough and more

One sack to see, one conquered town survive ! '
Here, here my corpse is laid ; bid that farewell! Ι
Death mine own hand will find. The pitying foe 3645
Will spoil me soon ; a tomb is little loss. l

A weary while Ι linger, banned by Heaven, ¹
Useless, since me Heaven's Sire, and all men's King l
Swept with his thunder’s blast, and smote with fire l' ‘

“So hs kept prating, and unshaken stayed. 6 50
With tears we plead, my wife, my little son,
And all our house, that he involve not all
In ruin, nor press on the insistent doom.

Still he says nay, not changing mind nor place.

“ Back to the fight I rusb, and choose to die, 6 ς 5
Most wretched! for what plan, what chance remained?
l to escape, O Father! and to leave
Thee ! Fell such slander from a parent’s tongue l
If the Gods will that nought be left of Troy,
And thou art firm, and wilt to wreck so large 660
Add thee and thine, Death's door will gape anon,
When Pyrrhus comes, who sheds the father's blood
Before the shrine, the son’s before his sire.
Was it for this, sweet Mother, me through shafts,
Through flames thou barest, in the heart of horne 665
To see my foes, to see my son, my sire,
