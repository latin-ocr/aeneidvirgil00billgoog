Then cold with sudden awe my comrades’ blood

F roze, and their spirit fell. No more with arms, 260
With vows and prayers they bid me strive for peace,
Whether divine they be or fowls obscene.

My father on the beach, with palms outspread,

Invokes the Gods, ordaining sacrifice.

‘0 curb her threats, great Heaven ! avert the curse! 26 5
With mercy guard the good !’ The cable then

He bids us pull from shore, and loose the sheets ;

The South winds fill the sails ; through foaming waves

We skim the track where breeze and pilot call.

“ Wooded Zacynthus, and Dulichium
Rise from the sea, and N eritos' tall crags,
And Same, and we skirt Laertes’ land,
Steep Ithaca, and curse Ulysses' home.
Soon too the cloudy peaks of Leucas show,
And that Apollo whom the scarnen dread.
Wearied we steer to make the little town,
Cast anchor from the proW, and beaeh the stern.

“Thus gaining land unhoped, our lustral dues
To Jove we pay, and, kindlin g altar-fires,
With Trojan Games we throng the Actian shore. 280
There, stripped and sleek with oil, my comrades try
Their country falls 3 so many an Argive town
Rejoicing to have passed, and fled the foe.

“The Sun rounds all the year, and Winter frore
Chafes with North winds the sea. Then on the gates 28 5
I fix a hollow brazen shield, the wear
Of mighty Abas, with this legend graved:
‘ These arms Aeneas from victorious Greeks !’
I bid the seamen weigh, and man the thwarts ε
Stoutly they smite the waves, and sweep the sea. 290
And soon we lose Phaeacia's skiey tops,
