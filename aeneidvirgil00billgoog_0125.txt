“ Deep pondering, I prayed the Woodland Nymphs,
Ι prayed Gradivus, Lord of Getic fields,
To bless that portent, and all harm remove.
But when with greater effort, ’gainst the sand
Pressing my knees, a third green spear Ι seize-
O shall I speak, or hold my peace l-a moan
Deep in the mound is heard, a tearful moan,
And a voice meets my ears: ‘Why dost thou rend
A wretched man, Aeneas? Spare my grave ;
Spare to pollutepure hands. Not strange to thee
Troy bore me ; no strange blood is oozing here ;
Fly, fly this cruel land, this greedy shore!
For I am Polydorus, Here the steel,
Sown in my flesh, hath sprouted into spears.'

“ Then doubt and dread oppressed me, and I stood
Spell-bound 3 my hair uprose, my tongue was tied.
This Polydorus wit'h a weight of gold
Once sad-starred Priam sent in secret charge
To Thracia's Prince, mistrusting Dardan arms, ’
Seeing his walls girt close. When Troy was crushed,
And Fortune ebbed, to Agamemnon’s arms
Turning in victory’s wake, the Prince breaks through
All law, slays Polydorus, and the gold
Grasps. To what acts thou drivest mortal men,
Thou impious greed of gold l When fear had fled,
To all our chiefest lords, my sire the first,

These portents I disclose, and ask their will.

One mind have all, to quit that guilty land,

Leave treason’s home, and give our barks the breeze.
So funeral rites we pay, earth high the mound,

And altars raise to Polydorus' shade, ’
Mourning with dusky cypress 3 and all round

Stand Ilian wives with streaming tresses free ;

Cups with warm milk afoam, and bowls we bear
