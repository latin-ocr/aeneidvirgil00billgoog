To her rich breast. Your ancient Mother seek l
There shall Aeneas’ House all nations sway,
And sons 5f⁸01llalffl generations fail !'

“Thus Phoebus ; and ajoyous uproar rose,
And all demanded, to wha't Home the God .
Called us, and bade the wanderers return.

“ My father then revolves the lore of old.
‘Listen, Ο lords !’ he eries, ‘and learn your hopes.
Crete lies amid the sea, Jove's island home,

Mount Ida, and the cradle of our race,

An hundred cities fair, luxuriant fields.

Thence our first father Teucer,-if the tale

I well recall-first sailed to Phrygian shores,
And chose his realm. Not then had Ilium raised
Her towers to heaven ; in sunken dales they dwelt.
Hence Cybele’s Queen, the Corybantic brass‚
The Idaean grove, the silence-guarded rites‚

And lions yoked beneath their mistress’ car.

Up, then, and follow where God's bidding leads ;
Appease the winds, and make for Gnossus' realm !
Not far the vessels’ course ; if Jove be near,
Three days shall bear them to the coasts of Crete.’
A bull to Neptune duly then he slew ;

A bull to thee, fair Phoebus ! and two lambs‚
One black to Storm‚ one to boon Zephyrs white.

“A rumour flies, Idomeneus hath left
His realm an outcast, and deserted homes
In Crete await us, of all foemen void.
We leave Ortygia’s port, and skim the main,
By N axos' Bacchic ridge, Donusa green,
White Paros, Olearos, o’er straits that foam
Round many a shore of sea-strewn Cyclades.
