An ever-during peace, a bridal pact.

Thou hast thine heart's desire. Dido with love
Burns, and through every vein draws passion in.
Rule we this people then with equal sway ἱ
r Jointly, and let her serve a Phrygian lord‚

And hand to thee for dower her Tyrian men.'’

To whom thus Venus-for be'neath that speech
She marked what craft to Libya would divert
The Italian crown: “ ’Twere madness to prefer
A war with thee! If when thy plan were done
· 'Twould issue well! But Ι am swayed by Fate
Uncertain if the Will of Jove intend
One city for the men of Tyre and Troy,

Both peoples blent and federate; but thou,

Thou art his wife ; thou may’st his mind essay.
Lead, and Ι follow.”

Juno then replied:

2 “Mine be that task. How to achieve our aim,
Hear now, and briefly learn. To hunt the glade
Aeneas and the woe-doomed Queen will ride
Together, when the morrow’s sun new-risen
Unveils the radiant world. While ranging scouts
Circle the wood with toils‚ a sleety storm
On them will Ι pour down, and shake the sky

’ With thunder. Then their train, dispersing wide,
Will vanish into gloom: the selfsame cave

Dido shall enter and the Trojan Prince.

There Ι shall be, and, if thy will be toward,
Joined in firm wedlock I will make her his.
There shall her bridal be l ''

t Assent was given,
And at her plot the Cytherean smiled.
