Your barks, to which I turned, whate'er might hap.
Enough forme to escape this cursed crew;
Ye rather take my life howe'er ye will ! '

“ He scarce hath said, when from the hills we see 6 ς 5
The shepherd Polyphemus with his flocks
Moving gigantic to the well-known shore ;
A Monster grim, huge, shapeless, reft of light.
A fir his hand hath lopped supports his steps ;

The woolly sheep attend him, sole delight,

Sole solace of his pain.

When the deep flood he touched and reached the sea,
There, gnashing loud his teeth, the oozing blood

From his gouged eye he laves, and through the main
Strides to the midst, nor wets his lofty sides.

Far thence in fear we fly, with him that prayed
And earned our grace, in silence cut the rope,
And bend with straining oars, and sweep thesea.
He hears, and turns his footsteps to the sound.
But when he fails to grasp us and to match

The Ionian waves in chase‚ a great uproar

He raised, whereat each billow of the sea

Shook, and the soil of Italy far down

Trembled, and Aetna’s hollow caverns roared.
Then from the woods and mountain sides aroused,
The one-eyed clan down rush, and fill the beach.
Vainly, with angry looks, we see them stand,
Brothers of Aetna, with sky-towering heads‚

An awful conclave ! as high oaks uplift

Their airy tops‚ or coned cypresses,

Jove's lofty forest, or Diana‘s grove.

“ F ear urged us then to slacken sheets, and spread
Our canvas to the wind. Far othe'r charge
The Prophet gave us, not to hold our way
'Twixt Scylla and Charybdis, on each hand
