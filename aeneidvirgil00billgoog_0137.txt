Suatching the feast, and with polluting touch
Spoil all; their shrieks are mixed with odours foul.
Once more, far-drawn within a caverned cliff‚

In shady trees embowered‚ we spread the board,
And on our altars lay the fire afresh 3

Once more from hidden lairs the screaming rout
Fly round the prey, with beaks and crooked claws
Tainting our meal. My comrades then I charged
To take their arms, and fight the grisly tribe ;
And they obeying lay their swords apart‚

¹Buried in grass, and hide their ambushed shields.
Then when they drop, and scream along the shore,
Misenus, from his watch, on hollow brass

Signals3 and in strange battle we engage,

Slashing with steel those Ocean Birds obscene.
But not one stroke their plumes, their bodies take
No wound ; and swift in flight upsoaring high,
Half-eaten meat they leave, and traces foul.

“Only Celaeno, evil-boding Seer,
Lights on a lofty crag‚ and thus breaks forth ε
‘War would ye wage for kine and oxen slain?
Sons of Laomedon l with war to drive
Innocent Harpies from their fathers’ realm ! ’
Leam then, and fix in heart these words of mine,
Which Jove foretold to Phoebus, he to me,
And I, the Furies’ Queen, to you reveal.
To Italy you sail : the summoned winds
Unharmed shall bear you to Italian ports.
But, ere you ring with walls your promised Home,
Fierce famine and this outrage of our blood,
Shall make you champ and gnaw your very boards.'

“She ceased, and to the forest wiuged her flight.
