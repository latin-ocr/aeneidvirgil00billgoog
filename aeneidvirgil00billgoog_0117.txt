Now fear each breeze, and start at every sound, ’
Trembling for both, my burden and my boy.

“ Now, drawing near the Gates, I deemed my way 730

All traversed, when a sound of many feet

Springs on our ears, and, peering through the gloom,
My father cries, ‘Fly, fly 1 my son, they come 1
The gleam of brass Ι see, and glowing shields.'

“ Then in my sear sothe deity unkind

Stole my distracted wit ; Ι for while I tread
By-ways, and leave the street’s familiar round,
Alas ! my wife Creusa, rapt by Fate,

Or stopped, or lost the way, or sank foredone,

. Uncertain which, ne'er to my sight restored.

N or looks for her thus lost nor thoughts I bent,
Ere to the mound we came and hallowed seat
Of ancient Ceres. Here, when all were met,
She only lacked, and failed both son and spouse.
What man, what God did not my fury accuse?
What sight more cruel was in all Troy's sack?
My son, my sire, my Trojan Gods of Home,
Hid in a winding glen, I trust to friends,

The town regam, and don my shining arms ;
Firm to renew each risk, and through all Troy
Retuming‚ thrust my head on peril again.

“The walls and dusky portals whence Ι passed
First 1 regain, and follow through the night
My foot-prints back, and with close eye peruse.
Dread fills my heart; the very silence daunts.
Thence home Ι turn, if haply there she tread,
If there ! The Greek invader fills the house.
The hungry firc is rolling up the roof ,
Wind-swept; the flames leap up and roar to heaven.
