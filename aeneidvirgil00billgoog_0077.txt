Infasshcdell but 1 vowed, if Fate were kind,

If Ι regained my Greece a conqueror, 9 ς
To avenge him. Thus 1 stirred relentless hate.

Hence first my ruin sprang. Ulysses hence
. Kept threatening slanders, and among the mean

Sowed rumours dark, and sought conspiring arms:

Nor rested, till by Calchas' aid- But why

Recount the graceless talei Why hold you back,

If Greeks rank all as one, and 'tis enough

That name to hear? Take vengeance now, and sate

Ulysses' hope, the Atridae’s dearest wish l’

“At that we, strangers to Pelasgian guile
And guilt so heinous, burn to ask his tale,
And trembling he proceeds with treacherous soul :

“ ‘ F ain were the Danaans oft to make retreat
From Ilium, wearied of the endless war,
O would they had gone! As oft the storm-lashed sea 110
Bound them on shore, and the rude South deterred.
And loudest when this Horse stood ready framed
With maple beams, all heaven with tempest roared.
And when in doubt to Phoebus' shrine we sent
Eurypylus, this sad response he brought:
“With blood of maiden slain you calmed the gale,
When first, O Greeks, you came to Ilium's shore.
Seek now return with blood, and sacrifice
An Argive life 1³³

The message went abroad,

And dazed our wits, and through our marrow shot
Cold shudders, who should be the victim doomed.
Ulysses then with clamour to our midst
Calchas, the Seer, drew, and charged to unfold
God's Will.-And many of that bad plot before

Warned me, and silently foresaw the end-
