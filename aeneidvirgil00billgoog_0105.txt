Dealt with his foeman Priam; he revered

The suppliant’s plea, and to the tomb restored

Hector's cold corse, and sent me home to Troy!

He spake3 and hurled his weak unwarlike spear,

Which, straight recoiling from the raucous bronze, 545
Hung idly from the buckler’s central boss

“Then Pyrrhus: ‘Thou shalt go then with the news
To Peleus’ son, my sire l Tell him, be sure,
The wicked deeds of his degenerate son l
Now die!' So saying, to the very shrine 550

He dragged him trembling, slipping in the blood
of his own son, and held his hair, and flashed

The blade‚ and hid it in his side biit-deep.

“So ended Priam's day: such doom he met, ,
Seeing his Troy in flames, and all her towerss 555
Down-cast ; once Lord of lands and peoples wide,
Regent of Asia. Now a mighty trunk
Lies headless on the shore, a corpse unnamed.

“ Then first wild sear embraced me, and I stood
Awe·struck. The form of my dear father rose 560
Before me, as I watched that King like-aged
Pant out his life. Ι saw Creusa left,

My house destroyed, the peril of my boy. μ

With backward glance Ι sum the force around.

All wearied out have flagged, and on the ground 565
Tumbled, or aching dropt into the flames.

“Now Ι alone was left; when, by the shrine
of Vesia crouched, silent and close, Ι saw

Tyndaresys’fdanghter, for the ἷξες shone bright
