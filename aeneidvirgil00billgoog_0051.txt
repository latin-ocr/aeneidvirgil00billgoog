We are not come with steel to overthrow

The Libyan's home, or harry prey to shore,—

N ot ours, not 'conquered men's, such insolence!

A Land there is, by Greeks Hesperia named,

An old land, strong in arms and the glebe’s fruit,
Where dwelt Oenotrians ; now the younger men,
After their Chief have called it Italy.

Thither we took our course,

When stormy Orion rose with sudden swell,

And dashed us on blind shoals, and with bluff winds
O'er desperate seas and rocks unvoyageable .
Dispersed us wide, and few have reached your shores.
What race of men is here l What land so rude
Permits this use? The welcome of the sand
Refused, they force us from their country’s edge.
If men and mortal weapons ye despise,

Look yet for Gods remembering right and wrong l
Aeneas was our King, and none more just

Or righteous, or in battle more renowned.

Whom if Fate still preserves‚ if still he drinks

The air of heaven, nor lies in bitter gloom,

We fear not ; nor shalt thou, if first to help,
Repent. Sicilian arms and towns remain,

Acestes too boasts the pure blood of Troy.

Grant us to beach our tempest-shaken ships,

To shape in woods new beams, and trim new oars,
And, if we may, with King and fellows found,
lllllatllilllhftlli llll, ne sea

Hold, and Iulus’ promise is no more,

Then seek we straits Sicilian, whence we came,

A Home now ready, Acestes for our King.”

So spake Ilioneus ; the Dardans all
Acclairning roared.
