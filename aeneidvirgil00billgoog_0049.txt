While all these wonders met the Dardan's eyes,
While lost he stood, in one long gaze entranced,
Queen Dido to the temple paced, a train
of courtiers pressing round, supremely fair.

As on Eurotas' banks, or Cynthus' hill,

Diana leads the dance ; behind her throng

A thousand Oreads: she the quiver bears,

And treads the earth, divine above them all.
Latona's beart with silent pleasure thrills.

Even such was Dido : so she passed in joy
Amidst them, busied in her city's growth;
Then in the sacred doors, beneath the dome,
High on a throne she sat, with weapons fenced,
Gave law and judgment, and the appointed task
Justly to each assigned, or fixed by lot:

When lo l Aeneas in the crowd discerns
Antheus, Sergestus, and Cloanthus brave,

With many a Trojan, whom the blinding gale
Had swept apart‚ and borne to distant shores.

Struck dumb together, both by fear and joy,
Hean'd'lleliates fain would grasp their hands,
Yearning, but ignorance disturbs their minds, 515
And, veiled in hollow mist, they wait to see
What fate was theirs, and where they left the ships,
And why they came 3 for, chosen from all the fleet,
Clamorous they near the temple, praying grace.

When they had entered, and due audience gained, 520
Ilioneus, their eldest, with calm front
Be an: r -

g “O Queen! by Heaven ordained to found
This city, and curb the unruly tribes with law !
Thee we poor Trojano, blown o’er every sea,
Implore. Ο save our ships from shameless firel 525
Spare honest men ; more nearly look on us!
