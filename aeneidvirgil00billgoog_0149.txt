Insatiate, and thrice sucks the swirling flood
Sheer down her gulf, and thrice again upspouts
Alternate, lashing the high stars with spume.
But Scylla, crouched in her blind cavern's lair,
With jaws out-thrust, pulls vessels on the rocks ;
A human face above ; a maid's fair breast
Down to the waist; below a monstrous shark,
With dolphin’s tail to wolfish belly joined.
Better to round Pachynum's goal, and fetch

A long and weary compass, than to sight
Scylla but once within her vasty cave,

And hear rocks echo to her sea-green houndsl

“ ‘ Now if some prescienee, some prophetie fame
Pertain to Helenus, if Phoebus fill
His soul with truth, this one thing, Goddess-born!
One above all I warn thee, o'er and o'er
Repeating, first to mighty Juno pray;
To Juno chant thy vows, and win with gifts
The potent Queen ; so, leaving Sicily,
Victor at last, Hesperia thou shalt gain.

“ ‘And when thou drawest near to Cumae town,
The mystic pools, Avernus’ murmuring grove,
There shalt thou see the Prophetess inspired,

Who sings the fates of men and writes on leaves.
Whate’er she writes on leaves she sorteth well,

And in her cave keeps close. There they remain
Unchanged, in sequence true. But when the hinge
Turns, and a light air stirring through the door
Blows the thin leaves about, no care hath she

To catch them as they flutter through the cave,
Nor set them right, nor make the verses meet.-
Men leave unhelped, and hate the Sibyl’s den.—
Here count not thou delay too dearly bought,
Though comrades chide, though strongly calls the sea,
