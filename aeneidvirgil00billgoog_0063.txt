To dim Sichaeus' image, and forestall
That heart long idle with a living love.

Soon as the feast is lull’d, they move the boards,
And lace great bowls, and wreathe the wine with flowers.
Din ills the house, and through the spacious halls 725
Roll voices. Burning lampa from the gilt roof
Depend, and torches overcome the night.
Then, calling for a jewell’d golden cup,
Pure wine the Queen pours in, after the use

Of Belus and his House, and silence falls.

“Jove, since to thee the guest-rites are assigned,
For Tyrians and for Trojans make this day
Glorious, a day our children shall recall l
Come, Bacchus, Joy-giver, and juno kind,

And ye‚ Ο Tyrians, give this gathering grace !''

Ending, wine-tribute on the board she shed ;
And first the cup touched lightly with her lips,
Then passed to Bitias, clinking 1t. F ull slow ,
He quaffed the bowl, deep diving tn the gold:
Then drank the other Chiefs

’ Iopas too
Made sound his golden harp, whom Atlas taught.
He sang the wandering Moon, and the Sun's toils‚

The source of Man and Beast, Lightning and Storm,
Arcturus and the rainy Hyades,

And the two Bears; why winter Suns so soon

Dip in thesea, what stays the laggard nights.

The Tyrians, then the Trojans, shower applause.

Nor less with divers talk the hapless Queen
Protracts the night, drinking long draughts ol'love3
Of Priam and of Hector asking much,
