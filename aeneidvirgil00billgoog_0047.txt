Achates, is not filled with our distressi

See Priami Even here Worth finds its meed;
Tears fall, and hearts are touched by mortal things l
Fear not ; this farne will surely bear thee safe.'’

Thus on the pictured show he feeds his beart,
Sighing, and streaming tears bedew his cheek.
For there he saw how, fighting round the walls,
Pressed by Troy's chivalry, the Greeks took flight,
Or Phrygians, where Achilles urged his car.
Nor distant Rhesus' snowy tents he knew,
Which, in first sleep betrayed, Tydides heaped
With bloody daughter, and his burning steeds
Turned back to camp, or ever they should taste
F odder of Troy, or drink of Xanthus' stream.
Elsewhere flies Troilus, his weapons lost,-
Ill—doomed, ill-matched to rneet Achilles’ spear l-
Dragged by his steeds, fallen from the empty car,
But grasping still the reins; his neck, his locks
Are drawn in dust, where scrawls the inverted spear.
And Ilian wives were wending, supplicant,
To cruel Pallas’ fane, with streaming hair,
And bare the Peplus, sad, and beat the breast:
Fixed on the ground the Goddess kept her eyes.
Thrice had Achilles round the walls ol Troy
Dragged Hector, and would sell his corse for gold.
Ah ! deeply then Aeneas sighed to view
His comrade's spoils, his car, his very corse,
And Priam stretching out his helpless hands.
Himself too, charging through Achaean chiefs,
The Eastern troops he knew, and Memnon’s arms.
And, burning mid the fray, her Amazons
With rnoony shields Penthesilea led,
Who, girt with gold beneath her naked breast,
Dared clash with men, a warrior and a maid.
