But Venus m her beart new purposes,
New schemes designs, that Love shall be transformed
To sweet Ascanius’ shape, and by his gifts
Stir 1nto flame the Queen's impassioned heart.
The doubtful House she fears, the twi-tongued race3
Fierce Juno galls, and care with N ight returns:
So in these words she speaks to winged Love:

“Dear Son, my strength, my sole effectual might,
Son, who dost scorn the Father's thunder- stones
Which slew Typhoeus, to thy knees Ι fly,

And pray thy godhead. How through Juno’s spite
Aeneas, thine own brother, roves the world,
Thou knowest, often hast thou shared my pain
Him now Phoenician Dido with soft words
Keeps, and Ι fear how Juno's guest may fare.

On such a hinge of fate she will not sleep.

I plan to circumvent her, and the Queen

Invest with flame no deity may quench.

Love for Aeneas then shall bind her mine.

How thou canst compass this, our purpose hear.
E'en now the princely Boy, my chiefest care,

By his dear Sire’s command, the city seeks,

With 'gifts that sea and Trojan flames have spared.
Him, sunk in sleep, 1 on my holy seat,

Cythera, or the Idalian hills, will hide,

Lest he should know the plot, and corne between.
Thou, for one night alone shalt personate

His shape, thy boyish looks transform to his;

So, when the feast runs high, and wine· -cups llow,
And radiant Dido takes thee rn her lap,

And fondles thee, and gives thee kisses sweet,

A poisonous secret fire thou may'st instill.”
