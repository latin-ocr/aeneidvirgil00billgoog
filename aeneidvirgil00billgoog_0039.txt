Whoe’er thou art, be gracious, ease our pain ; 3 3ο
And teach us on what shores, beneath what sky,

Outcast we wander, ignorant of place

And people, hither driven by storm and sea.

Oft at thine altars shall our victims fall.”

Then Venus: “ Nay, such rites are not for me. 335
To bear the quiver Tyrian maidens use,
And the red buskin on the leg bind high.
Carthage this realm‚ Agenor's Tyrian town,
But Libyans bound it, tribes intractable.
Here reigns, from Tyre and from her brother fied, 340
Queen Dido. Long her sorrows, long and dark;
But Ι will tread the surface of the tale.

“ Sichaeus was 'her sponse, of Tyrian lords
The richest, and loved dearly to her woe.
To him her father yoked her still intact, 345
With virgin rites; buton Tyre's throne her brother,
Pygmalion, sat, in guilt out-shaming all.
Wrath came between those twain. He, blind with greed
And careless of his sister's love, struck down
Impious before the shrine with furtive steel 3 50
Unwarned sichaeus, and long hid the deed,
Cheating with empty tales sick Dido's heart.
’ But in her dreams her lord's unburied shade
Came with a strange wan face, revealing all,
The guilty shrine, the dagger's bosom-theust, 355
And all the sightless horror of the House.
He bad her haste to leave her native shores,
Disclosing ancient treasures underground,

κ Silver and gold unsummed, her journey's aid.

She, thus distract, sought friends to share her flight, 360
And all who loathed the tyrant King‚ or feared,
Muster, and seize what galleys lie to hand,
