Lonely, 'with no sweet babes, no crown of Love?

Think'st thou the buried ghost heeds aught of that?

Wha't though no lover moved thee in thy grief, 35
In T'yre, or Libya ; not Iarbas scorned,

Nor any Prince of Afric’s conquering clirne,

Yet wilt thou wrestle with a welcome love?

Hast thou no thought in whose domains we dwell,

Tameless Gaetulians here, and all around 40
Unreined N umidians and the Syrtes waste ;

There desert drought, and Barce's savage bordes?

What need to tell of wars that spring from Tyre,

Thy brother’s menace?

Guided by Gods I hold and juno-’alost 45
Troy-’efieetwas'h'hrt‘efbiown Ο what a city,

Thus speaking, she made flame her glowing beart,

F illed her racked mind with hope, loosed Honour's rein. 55
f They seek the‘s'hrines3 they pray for peace, and slay

Choice ewes to Ceres, Bearer of the Law,

To Phoebus and LyaeuS, but in chief

To Juno, Guardian of the marriage bond.

Dido herself, ‚most fair, with bowl in hand, 60

Pours o'er a white cow’s horus, before the Gods

Paces to their rich altars, and the day ,

Hallows with gifts‚ and in the victim's breast

Gazing takes counsel of the breathing heart.

Ο blind Diviners ! How can vow or shrine
