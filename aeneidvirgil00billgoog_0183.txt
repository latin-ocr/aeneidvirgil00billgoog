Not such his mother promised him to us,

And not for this twice saved him from the Greek ;
But o’er the Imperial Mother's warrior sons,

O’er Italy to reign, from Teucer's blood

Prolong the line, and bind the world by law.

lf no such glory fires him, if no toil

For his own fame he takes, yet doth he grudge
His son Ascanius the high towers of Rome?
What makes he there with foes? why not regards
Ausonian seed, and fair Lavinium's land?

To Sea! This sums it. Thus our message bear.”

He ceased; the other, his great Sire's command
Obeying‚ first the golden sandals tied,
That bear him over seas and lands sublime,
Winged with the flying gale ; then took the wand,
With which he calls the pallid phantoms forth
From Orcus, or to Tartarus sends down,
Gives sleep and takes away, and the dead eyes
Unseals, and drives the hurricane, and swims
The cloudy rack. Then flying he descried
Worn Atlas' sides and sky-supporting top,
Atlas, whose piney head is ever wreathed
In cloud and darkness, beat by wind and rain.
Snow cloaks his shoulders ; rivers 0’er his chin
Plunge downward, and his beard is stiff with ice.

Here first Cyllenius, weighing his spread wings, ¹
Paused, and with all his body headlong dived
Sea-ward, as when a bird about the shores
And fishy crags flies low, and skims the wave.
So flew Cyllene's son, his grandsire lest,
Between the earth and sky, and cut the winds

 

To Libya's sandy shore. L
