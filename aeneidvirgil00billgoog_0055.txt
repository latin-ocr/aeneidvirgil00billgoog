Then he, thus sudden, unforese'en of all,
Addressed the Queen:
“I whom ye seek am here, 595
Trojan Aeneas, saved from Libyan seas.
O thou sole pitier of Troy’s untold woe !
Thou who with us, the leavings of the Greek,
By land and sea outworn, in want of all,
Would'st share thy city and home! To render thanks 600
Fitly, 1 cannot, Dido, nor could aught
Of Dardan blood o’er the wide world dispersed.
May Heaven, if any Spirits guard the Good,
IfJustice aught avail, or conscious Worth,
Reward thee fitly! Owhat glad ages bore, 605
What mighty parents got thee so benign!
While brooks run seaward, while the shadows move
Round mountain vales, and star-flocks graze in heaven,
Thy fame, thy name, thy praise shall still endure,

“ Whatever shores call me.’'

And both his hands 610

Sought dear Serestus and Ilioneus ;
Then all, brave Gyas and Cloanthus brave.

Astonished by his looks, then by his plight
AnTi'soTedi‘stress, Sidofflido spake:

· “ What Doom pursues thee, Qoddess-born? what spite 615
Casts thee so peril-rost on barbarous'si'r‘ffffd'st

Art that Aeneas whom sweet Venus bore

Dardan Anchises by the Simois stream?

I mind how Teucer, from his land expelled,

To Sidon came, and sought to win new realms 620
By Belus’ aid. My father Belus then

Laid Cyprus waste, and swayed the captive isle.

And from that day Ι knew the fall of Troy,

1 knew thy name, and the Pelasgian Kings.
