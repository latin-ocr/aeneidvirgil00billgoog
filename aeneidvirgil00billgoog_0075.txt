The Trojan crowd flow round from every side.
Eager to see, and vie in mocking him.

Hear now the Danaans' craft, and from one crime
Learn all the breed.

“ For, standing in our midst, confused, unarmed,
And looking round the Phrygian ranks, he spoke:

“‘ Alas! What land, what sea can now receive
Me miserable? What last resort is left?
No place for me with Greeks, and Dardans too
To satisfy their hate demand my blood ! '

“His anguish turned our hearts, and all assault
Fell checked. We bid him tell us of his birth,
His news, the hope on which a prisoner leant.
He, when his fear is banished, thus returns:

“‘All I will tell thee true, O King. ¹ whate’ er
Befall me, nor mine &Ar-give birth „deny
That first: if Fortune moulded Sinon's life
Joyless, the jade shall never shape him false!
If haply to thine ears hath come the name
Of Palamedes and his high renown3
Whom, since he blamed the war, Greeks falsely charged,
On witness base doomed 1nnocent to die,
And life· lorn now lament, -his friend was Ι, 8 5
A kinsman of his House, when at my prime
My needy father sent me to the wars.
While he stood firm ιιι place, and wielded power ’ .
ln the Kings' councils, we bore something too
Of name and farne 3 but when Ul sses’ grudge,- 90
No news l tell,-had thrust him dom the light,
In grief obscure Ι languished, sore at heart
Resenting my friend’s fall ; nor held my peace,
