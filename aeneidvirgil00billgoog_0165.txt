The edge of ruint so our sails are backed3
And lo l the North wind from Pelorus’ strait
Blows, and Pantagia's living stones I pass,
And Megara’s gulfi and Thapsus’ lowly strand.
Such shores the comrade of Ulysses' pain
Showed us, recoasting where he sailed of yore.

‘⁴ Off the Sicanian bay, an lsland lies,
Against wave-washed Plemyrium, named of old
Ortygia. There Alphaeus, Elis’ stream,
Stole underseas‚ men say, by secret paths‚
And through thy fount, O Arethusa ! pours
Into Sicilian seas : to whom, forewarned‚
We pay our vows; then, past the luscious meads
Of still Helorus, graze Pachynus’ reefs:
Till Camarina, whom the Fates forbade
To move her marsh, shows far, and Gela's plain,
Gela that bears its churlish river's name.
Then Acragas the steep‚ the getter once
Of noble steeds, shows her great walls afar.
Thy palms‚ Selinus, on the granted gale
I leave, and thread the Lilybaean shoals,
And sunken reeh, till on the joyless strand
Of Drepanum I stay. There, tempest-tost
So long, ah me‘! my father, comforter
Of every ill, I lose. There me outworn,
Thou leavest, father, rescued all in vain l
Not Helenus, foretelling things of dread,
Told me this sorrow, nor Celaeno grim.
This was my latest woe, my long road’s end.
Departed thence, God drove me to your shores.''

One before all intent, Aeneas thus
The doom of Heaven retold, and all his ways ;
Then hushed, and rested, when the tale was done.
