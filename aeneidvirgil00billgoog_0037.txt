Harbour to rojans, lest, unware of F ate,

Dido should purn them. Through the air he oars 300
His rapid vans, and lights on Libyan soil.

His task is done: the savage hearts are lulled

By God’s own Will: but rnost o'er Dido’s soul

Steal gentle thoughts, and ruth for Teucer's sons.

Now good Aeneas, tossed all night with care, 305
When the boon light was given, resolved to try .
. Those unknown shores, to what strange coast the blasts
Had blown them, and who held it, man or beast‚—
Desert it seemed,-and bear true tidings back.
Beneath an arching rock, o‘er·hung with trees, 310
He hid his vessels, wrapt in woodland shade‚
And with Achates started, in his hand
Shaking two steel·bound spears.
Hirn in mid-wood

ζ His Mother came to meet, a maid in looks,
&Bearing the arms and habit of a maid,

Spartan, or like Harpalyce, whose feet

Outstrip the horse, outrun the Hebrus stream.
For huntress-wise o‘er shoulders she had slung
The bow to hand, and given the winds her hair,
Bate-kneed, her folds up-gathered in a knot. ἲ

She first began: “ Sirs, have you haply seen
One of my sisters wandering this wood,
With quiver girt‚ and spotted lynx's skin‚
Or pressing clamorous on the foaming boar l '' ¹

ξ Thus Venus, and thus answered Venus’ son:
“ N one of thy sisters have Ι heard or seen,
O-how to call thee, Maid? .No mortal face,
No human voice is thine,-O Goddess, sure!

y Art thou §Poudq sister, or some Nymph l
