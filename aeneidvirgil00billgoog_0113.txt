My wife, all butehered in each other's blood?

Arms, men, bring arms l Death calls the conquered on l
Give me again to Greeks! Let me renew

Battlel Not all shall perish unavengedl 670

“I gird the steel again, and my left arm
Strap to the targe, and step beyond my house :
But on the theshold lo ! my wife embraced ⁴ ·
My feet, and to his father held my boy.
‘If death thou seekest‚ bear us with thee too l
But if, well-tried, thou hast some hope in arms,
Shield first this house! To whom shall we be left,

Thy son, thy sire, and I, once called thy wife l’

“ Loudly she tried, and filled the house with moans:
When suddenly a wondrous Sign uprose.
For lo ! between his parents’ arms and lips
Above Iulus' head there seemed to glow
A thin peaked light, a harmless flame, that played
About his wavy locks, and licked his brow.
With fear we trembled, and the burning hair
Shook, and with water quenched the holy flames ε
But old Anchises to the stars upturns
Joyful his eyes, to Heaven lifts hand and voice. -
‘Almighty l If any prayers bend thy Will,
Look on us, only look ! If worth deserve‚
Ο give us help l Confirm this augury l’

“ Scarce had the old man said, when on the left
Thunder outcrashed‚ and, sliding from its sphere‚
A Stat shot through the darkness, trailing light.
Above our palace roof we saw it glide,

 

And bury its splendour in dark Ida’s woods‚
