When from his lofty couch the Prince began :

'³ χ 2 “ Unutterable, O Queen, the pain thy words
Bid me revive; how Troy's unhappy realm

Fell to the Greek ; what piteous scenes Ι saw 5
And was great part of. Who, in such a tale,

From hard Ulysses' ranks‚ what Myrmidon

Would keep from turs? And dewy Night e’en now

Is riding down the sky, the sinking stars

Persuade to sleep. Yet, isso strong thy wish 10
To learn in brief our woes and Troy‘s last hour,

Although my memory shudders and recosss,

1 will assay.

“War-shattered, foiled by Fue,
As the long years roll on, the Danaan chiefs,
By Pallas' sacred art, build mountain-high, 15
Ribbed with sawn fir, a Horse; a votive gift
For safe return, they feign ; so rumour spreads.
Men chosen by lot in its blind flanks are hid
In secret, and with armed soldiery
The monstrous cavern of its belly filled. 20

“ In sight lies Tenedos, an isle renowned
widely, and rich while Priam's kingdom stood,
Now but a bay and faithless anchorage.
They, sailing thither, on the desert coast
Lie hid; but we suppose them on the wind 2 5
For Argos bound. An Troy shakes off her grief ς
The Gates are o en thrown, the Dorie Camp,
The shores forsafien, gaily visited.
Here the Dolopians pitched, Achilles here;
Here lay the ships, here was the battle-field. 30
