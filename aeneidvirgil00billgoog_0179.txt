The scattered Trojans, and the Dardan child

o'f Venus' son, for shelter scoisr the fields ·
Fearful, while torrents from the mountains plunge.
One cave holds Dido and the Trojan Prince.
Primaeval Earth and spousal Juno grve

The sign: fires glitter, and the conscious sky
Their bridal lights, and mountain N ymphs cry hail.

Death’s earliest day, the primal source was that
Of all her woes. She heeds nor eye nor tongue, ·
Nor dreams of secret love, but calls rt now ·
M Qe, and with that name would screen her fault.

Forthwith runs Rumour through the Libyan towns ;
Rumour, the swiftest bane. She thrives on change,
And gathers strength by going. Small at first,
And timorous, but full soon, to heaven uplift,
She treads the earth and hides in clouds her head.
Her Earth, infuriate with the Gods, conceived‚
To Coeus and Enceladus, farne saith,
Last sister born ; swift-footed, swift of wing,
Grim, monstrous, huge: and every plume she bears
,Hath under it a glaring eye, a tongue,
¹Wondrous! a speaking mouth, and ears erect.
By night she flies from earth and heaven midway,
Strident, nor droops her lids in pleasant sleep.
By day she sits on roof or lofty tower,
A sentinel who keeps great towns in fear,
Truth's herald, but as olt in falsehood bold.
She'snowrejoicing fills the· people’s ears
With wild discourse, and tells both false and true ; 190 ‘
How one of Trojan blood, Aeneas, came, f μ
Whom Dido deigns to wed ; all winter long, lilioli&
Delights they share, and both their realms forget,
Enthralled by shameful love. Such tales abroad
