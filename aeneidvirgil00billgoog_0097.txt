From our arms' fashion, our mistaken plumes.

With yells and anger for the rescued maid,

Greeks from all sides attack us, Ajax keen,

Atreus’ two sons, all the Dolopian host. 415
As, when a whirlwind breaks, South Wind and West,

And Eurus, with his orient coursers proud,

Conflicting shock: the forest roars; the sea

Neptune with savage trident stirs to foam.

They too, if any in the dark of night 4²0
Our craft surprised, and routed through the town,

Show themselves now ; our shields and cozening arms

At once they know, and mark our uncouth tongue.

N umbers o’erwhelm us, and Coroebus first

Before the War-Maid’s altar, by the hand

Of Peneleus falls dead ; and Rhipeus falls,

Our purest, and of honour most compact,-

The Godsgainsaid !-Dymas and Hypanis

Die, pierced by friends, nor all thy piety

Could save thee, Panthus, nor Apollo’s crown ! 430

“O Ilian ashes! Death-flames of my kin!
Be witness, that Ι shunned not at your fall
Greek spear or perilous warfare; that my hand
Earned death, had death been doomed! But sundered thence

With Pelias and with Iphitus Ι pass,- 43 ς
One Age retards, and one Ulysses' wound‚-
Where calls the tlamour, straight to Priam's house.

“Here found we battle fierce, as though no fray
Elsewhere, no other carnage filled the town ;
War to the death, our very roofs assailed, 440
And to beleaguered doors the Tortoise driven.
Their ladders hug the walls ; they storrn the Gate;
And with their left hand to our shafts oppose
Shields, while they grasp the coping with their right.
