Thy City thou may'st found on harbouring shores.
Signs I will show thee: keep thern close at heart.

When thou, perplexed, shalt find beneath the holms
That fringe a secret stream one monstrous Sow

Stretched on the ground, with thirty young new-born,

White‚ and the brood about her udders white,
There shalt thou build‚ there rest from pain secure.
Nor heed that future gnawing of thy boards,-

F ate shall find means, and Phoebus called be near.
But fly those lands, fly that Italian coast

Washed by our orient tides. In every town
Dwells the bad Greek. Locrians of Naryx there
Have built their walls. Idomeneus of Crete
Hath poured his warriors o'er Sallentine plains ;
And there that Meliboean chieftain's town,

Little Petelia, clinging to her wall.

“ ‘ Nay, when thy barks lie stayed across the main,
And vows thou payest, raising on the beach
Altars, thine hair with purple covert veil,

Lest in thy worship any hostile face

Crossing the hallowed fires thine omens spoil.
Keep thou and thine this mode of sacrifice :

Pure in this rite let thy descendants bide.

But when thou leavest, to Sicilian shores

Blown, and Pelorus’ narrow straits unfold,

Make the left coast, and sail with compass wide
The Southern waters, but the N orthern shun.
Those lands long since, by some vast force uptorn‚
(So strong to change is the slow lapse of Time‚)
Were cleft apart‚ men say, though once the twain
Were both one land. The sea broke in between,
Hesperia rent from Sicily, and pours

’Twixt fields and towns divorced a narrow tide.

Scylla the right, Charybdis guards the left
