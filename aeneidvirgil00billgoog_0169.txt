:h Α UT Dido, sick long since of painful love,

Κ, „2⁴ Feeds with her 'veins the wound‚ by fire unseen
«ιε’ ᾖ Wasted. The hero's prowess haunts her much,
Q Much his great tace. Fast in her heart are fixt
His looks, his words, and love denies her rest. ς

 

The mon-ow morn with Phoebus’ lamp the earth

When hei· twin-hearted sister thus distraught
She addressed :
“ What dreams, 0 Anna l scafe my soul !
O what a guest is this to us new-come ! 10
O what a mien, what frunt, what arms are his l
Not vain my faith that he is Heavenly born.
¹ Fear stamps the baser soul. Ο how the Fates
Have vext him ! How he told of battles waged !
Were not my mind irrevocabl fixed 1 5
With none to mate in wedloc ‚ since by death
Love, turning enitor, robbed me at the prime3
Were 1 not tired of bridal torch and bower„
To this one fault pei-chance 1 might succumb.

He only ,bath 'moved my heare, or made my will
Falten 1 know the marks, the flame of old ξ

With all his thunders hurl me to the shades, 25
Pale shades of Erebus, and Night profonnd, ’
Ere, Honour, thee 1 soih-or break [ΝΥ law!
He who first made me his took with him all
My heart; still let hirn keep it in his rave ¹. ''
She ceased, and rising tears her bosom led. 30

Then Anna : “ Dearer far than light is dear,
O Sister Ξ wilt thou wither all thy Spring
