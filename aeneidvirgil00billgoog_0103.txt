Old as he was, his long disused arms
Threw on his feeble back, his useless sword 5¹0
Girt on, and went to die among his foes.

“ Amidst the house, beneath the naked sky,

Stood a great altar, and a time-worn bay

Leant over, and the House-gods wrapped in shade.

Here, round the barren shrine, sat Hecuba 515
And all her daughters, huddled up like doves

ln the black tempest, clinging to their Gods.

But when she saw her lord in arms of youth,

‘Unhappy spouse 'what madness makes thee take

Those arms, 'she cried,‘ or whither would st thou gol 520
Not such the aid, nor such defence the times

Require‚ not were ωΜῘῚοεῑοῐ here himself.

Draw here at last: this shrine will save us all,

Or thou shalt die with us.' And by her side

She placed the age-worn King in holy seat. 525

“But lo! Polites, one of Priam's sons,
Flying from Pyrrhus’ sword, through locs, through spears,
Down the long corridors and vacant halls
Runs wounded. Pyrrhus, burning on the stroke,
Chases, and grasps, and threats him with the spear; 5 30
Till ,Just emerging in his parents' sight,
He fell, and shed his life tn streaming blood.
Then Priam, though with death now compassed round,
Withheld not, nor his voice or anger spared.

“‘For such a crime, ’he eries, ‘for such a feat, 535
May Heaven, if Pity dwell rn Heaven to mark
Such deeds, requite thee well, and give the meed
Thou earnest, who before mine eyes hast slain
My son, and inarred his father's sight with death.
Not thus Achilles, whom thou feign'st thy sire, 540
