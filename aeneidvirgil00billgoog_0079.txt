Ten days within his tent Calchas is dumh,
Denouncing none, condemning none to death ;
At last to loud Ulysses by concert ‚

Scarce breaks a word, and me to the altar dooms.
All gave assent, and on one victim's head

Let fall the ruin each had feared his own.

‘⁶ ‘ The dreadful day had come; my rites were set ;
The salted meal, the bands about my brow:
Ι broke away from death, Ι burst my bonds,
Ι do consessit! and all night lay deep
In darkling sedge, till haply they might sail.
And now no hope is mine to see my land,
Mine own sweet boys, my father dear-desired‚
Who even for my escape may pay the eost,
And with their piteous blood my guilt atone!
But O l by Heaven I pray thee! by the Powers
That reverence Truth! by F aith, if any F aith
Stays in the world unspotted, to such woe
Give pity, and to sufferings undeserved l'

“Life to his tears we grant, and pity too.
And Priam first his manacles and bonds
Himself bids loose‚ and thus benignly speaks:
‘Whoso thou art, henceforth forget the Greeks!
Ours thou shalt be! Now make me answer true. -
This monster Hotse, why built they i Who conceived? 150
For what? what holy vow? what craft of wari’
He said ; the other, in Pelasgian guile
Well-versed, to Heaven uplifts his unbound hands.

“ ‘ Ye everlasting fires inviolable,
Be witness l’ he exclaimed, ‘O Shrines, O Knives 155
From which Ι fied! O victim bands I wore!
