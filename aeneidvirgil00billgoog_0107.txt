As to and fro I passed, surveying all. 571d

She, Trojans' hatred for their towers o'erthrown,

The Greeks' revenge, her long-left husband‘s wr ath
Fore-dreading‚—common Fury of Greece and Troy l-
Had hidden, and by the altar lurked unseen.

“My heart burned hot : wrath spurred me to avenge 575
My falling land, and take the price of sin.
Was she to look on Sparta and her land
Unscathed, and in her triumph walle a Queen,

And Dardan blood so often poured like sweat?
Not so. For though no memorable name
Springs from a woman's death, no victor's palm,
Yet to quench evil, and repay desert 585
Shall bring me raise. Ο sweet to glut my soul

With vengeful dre, and sate my slaughtered kin l

“So raving, I advanced with furious beart ;
When in my sight, not seen before so clear,
And in pure radiance gleaming through the dark, 590

And young Iulus? All the Grecian hosts
About them range ; and, did my care not shieldrae-
Flames and the hostile blade had swept them off. 600
Not Helen's hateful beauty thou must blame,
Nor Paris: ’tis the Gods, the severe Gods,
