Sarpedon fell, where Simois rolls deep roo
Such shields and helms and bodies of the brave l '’

While yet he eries, the shrieking Northern storm
Strikes back the sail, aud heavenward lifts the surge.
Oars snap: the prow swings off, and gives the sea
The ship's broad side ; down breaks a mount of brine. 105
Some hang on the wave's erest ; some see the floor

’Twixt gaping seas3 the surges seethe with sand.
Three ships the South Wind hurls on ambushed rocks,
Rocks named by Latins “ Altars‚'’ in mid main

The East drives landward, piteous to be seen!
And strikes ashore, and heaps them round with saud.
One, leal Orontes' and the Lycians’ bork,

Down on her stern. The helmsman, wrenched away
Rolls headlong: but the eddy round and round
Thrice spins the ship, and gulfs her in the flood.
Rare show some swimming in the vasty race.

Arma, planks, and Trojan treasuresstrew the waves.
Ilioneus’ and bold Achates’ ships,

, Those which'bore‘Abas and Aletes old,

Yield to the storm; their loosened joints admit
The ruinous deluge through each gaping chink.

Meanwhile the discord of the boiling sea,
The Storm let loose, the watery deeps up·cast,
- Neptune perceived, and, gravely moved‚ looked forth,
Lifting above the wave his tranquil brow.
Strewn o'er the sea he saw Aeneas’ fleet,
He saw the Trojans spent with wind and wave‚
Nor did he not perceive his sister‘s guile. 130
East Wind and West he summons and bespeaks:
