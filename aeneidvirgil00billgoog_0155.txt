He sounds his signal clear 3 we move our camp,
Launch forth anew, and spread our vessels’ wings.

“The stars had fied before the reddening mom,
When far dim hills we saw, and lying low
Italy. ‘Italy ! ' first Achates cries;
And merrily the crews hail ‘Italy !'
Then Sire Anchises crowns a mighty bowl‚
And fills with wine, and calls upon the Gods,
High standing on the stern:
‘O Gods, supreme o'er earth and sea and sky !
Waft us with aiding wind, and breathe benign !’

“The wished-for breezes freshen, and the port
Widens more near, and on Minerva's Hill
A Temple shines. We, furling sail, our prows
Turn shoreward. Hollowed by the Eastern tide,
The port lies hid, its jutting horns afoam
With the salt spray: twin walls of towered rock
Stretch down, and from the shore the fane recedes
Four horses, our first omen, here we saw
Cropping the grassy lea, as white as snow.
Whereat Anchises: ‘War, strange Land, thou bearest,
For war the steed is armed; these threaten war. 540
Yet this same beast will learn the harness' use,
Drawing the car, and bearing concord’s yoke;
Hope too for peace,’ saith he. Invoking then

‘Krmed Pallas‘ might, who first our hail received,

Before her sacred shrine we veil our heads3 545
And duly, upon the Prophet's prime command,

To Argive Juno pay the sacrifice.

“ On, without stay, when all our vows were made,
Turning our sail-yard horns, those Greekish homes,
Suspected fields, we leave, and soon descry 550
