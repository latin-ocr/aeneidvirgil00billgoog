Chased far and wide· they now, in column long, 395
Alight‚ or soaring scorn the earth they trod

As they restored with clanging wings the sky

Circle rn sport, and utter songs ofj J,oy

Not otherwise thy ships and crews now hold

Gladly the port, or cross the bar full· sail. 400
Go, and step onward where thy path shall lead‘’

Ν She said, and turned; all rosy flashed her neck;
The ambrosial locks a heavenly fragrance breathed,
Her vesture flowed to earth, and by her gait
The Goddess stood confest.
He, when he knew 40 ς
His mother, thus pursued her as she fied :
“Thou too unkindl Why dost thou with false shapes
Mock me so oft? Why may we not clasp hands
Together, and with unfeigned lips conversel”
Thus he upbraiding paces to the town. 410
But round them, as they walked, the Goddess shed
A screen of mist and cloudy veil obscure,
That none might see or touch them, or delay,

ι lnquiring why they came. To Paphos she

Flies soaring, and delightedly regains 41 ς
Her home, her fane, her hundred shrines that glow
With Orient gums and with fresh garlands breathe.

Meanwhile they hasten where the pathway points 3
And climb at last the hill which hangs sar-stretched
Above the city and on her towers looks down. 420

At that great town, once hovels, the thronged gates,
The clattering streets, Aeneas much admires.
Hotly the Tyrians work: some trace the walls,
The castle build, and roll up stones by hand
Some trench a site for building. They ordain 42 5
Laws, magistrates, and senators august.
