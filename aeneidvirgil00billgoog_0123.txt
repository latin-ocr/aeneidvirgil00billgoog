Gods’ voices call us ς and in Ida’s shade, 5
Beneath Antandros' wall, we build a fleet ;

Uncertain to what bourne our fates will lead,

And muster men. When summer scarce had sprung,

And oft my sire bade spread our sails to Faoe,

Ι left my land with tem, I left the plain 10
That once was Troy, to sail the homeless scas,

With friends and son, with Troy’s great Gods and mine.

“ Far off, in Mavors* land, the Thracians plough
Their vasty plains, where erst Lycurgus reigned ;
To Troy once friendly, and our Gods allied, 1 5
Ere Fortune fled. There landing, on the hay,
With fates unkind‚ my earliest town 1 trace,
And name it from my name Aeneadae.

“ Oblations to my mother and the Gods,
To bless our works, 1 paid ; and to Heaven’s King 20
A shining bun would slay. A mound was nigh,
Whereon grew dogwood bushes, and dense spem
Of prickly myrtle. Drawing near, 1 strove
To crop the leafy wood, and wreathe with green
Our altars, when behold ! an awful sign, 2 5
Wondsous to tell ! for from the uprooted stem
Which first 1 tore from earth, black drops of blood
Gushed forth, and stained the soil. Cold horror shook
My limbs ; fear froze my blood. Yet once again

Out of another tree, I sought to tear 30 ⁴

A stubborn shoot, and probe the hidden cause.
Black from that other bark forth issued blood.
