The loathly Goddesd spreads on every tongue;

And, speeding straight to Prince Iarbas, him
With words she kindles, heaping high his wrath.

He, Ammon’s seed by Garamantian nymph,
An hundred sanes in his wide realm to Jove,
An hundred altars built, and hallowed fire,
The Gods' unsleeping sentry, and enriched
The soil with victims' blood, and with gay blooms
Festooned the courts: who, by that bitter tale
Maddened‚ before his shrines‚ amidst his Gods‚

Jove long in prayer besought with uplift hands.

“,Almighty ove! to whom on broidered couch
The feasting Moof now pours Lenaeus' gift,
Dost thou behold? or do we vainly shrink,

O F ather, from thy bolts, and do thy fires
Blindly affright, thy thunders idly roll?

The woman, straying in oursboun'ds, who built
A little purchased town, to whom we gave
Ploughland' and rights of fies, our hand refused,
Now takes Aeneas for her lord, and he,

This Paris, ,with his eunuch train, his chin
And essenced hair by Phrygian bonnet bound,
Takes and enjoys ! And yet to sanes of thine
We carry gifts, and nurse an idle faith !'’

Him, praying thus and clinging to his shrines‚
The UAlmighty-heard, and on the royal town 2ο
Looked', and on Q who loved forgetting fame, ciffi
Then thus to Mercury his mandate gave:
“ Go, Son, the Zephyrs call, and slant thy flight
Down to the Dardan Prince, who dallies yet
In Carthage, and of cities given by Fate 22 ς
Heeds nought. To him my words bear swiftly down.
