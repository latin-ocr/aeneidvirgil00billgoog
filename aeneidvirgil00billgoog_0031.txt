j “ Co-mates,—for troubles we have known before,-
O worse beset! these too some God will end!
Ye braved wild Scylla, and the rocks that roar 200
Through all their fissures, and the Cyclops' den .

Ye entered. Cheer your hearts l Abandon fear!

To recollect even this may yet be sweet.

Through many a danger, many a chance 3ηά change,

We tend to Latium, where the Gods assure 20 ς

ffid‘tlffi‘re‘alm of Troy again shall rise.
Elidit! and keep yourselves for happy days !”

Such words he spake3 and, pained with anxious thought
Masked under hopeful looks his beart-felt care.
They, hungry for the feast, prepare their prey, 210
Strip hide from ribs, 3ηά bare the inward meat.
Part carve and broach with spits the quivering flesh ;
Part fix the brazen pans, and ply the flame.
Then, stretched on grass, recalling strength with food,
Of venison and of wine they take their fill ;
Till, hunger stayed, they move the boards, and long
ln anxious converse mourn their comrades lost,
'Twixt hope 3ηά fear surmising if they live,
Or lie at rest, 3ηά hear no voice that calls.
But good Aeneas mourns at heart the most
For Amycus, Orontes, 3ηά sad-starred
Lycus, brave Gyas and Cloanthus brave.

Now came the close, when Jupiter looked down
. Over the soil-flecked sea, the lands outspread,

The shores, the peoples wide, and on Heaven's erest
Paused, and his downward gaze on Libya fixed.
Him then, thus pondering many an anxious thought,
Sadly, with tear-drops in her shining eyes,
Venus bespake ε “ Dread King of Gods 3ηά men,
Regent of rule eterne, the Thunder's Lord!
