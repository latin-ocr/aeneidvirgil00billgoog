The curse on him l-would sallon Priam's realm3
But if your hands should draw it up to Troy,

Asia herself should bring a world of war

On Pelops' town, and Doom await our sons'

“Such lying tales, by Sinon's glozing art, 195
· Gained credence, and a traitor’s tears entrapped
Whom not Tydides, not Achilles' self,

Not ten years mastered, nor a thousand ships.

“Now fell on us accurst a greater woe, l
More dreadful far, confusing our blind wit. .·'
Laocoon, uutmesutuaeetrirse
Stood by his shrine, to sacrifice a bull:

When lo ! from Tenedos, o’er tranquil sea,—
Ι shudder to recall l-with endless coils
Two Serpentsss'r‘e'ssed together toward the shore.

, Their bosoms rose above the wave‚ their crests
Blood-red o'er-topped the surge ; their hinder parts
Trailed on the flood in mighty sinuous folds, ι
And lashed the roaring brine. They reach our fields,
Their blazing eyes suffused with blood and fire,

And with lithe tongues beslaver mouths that hiss.
Pale at the sight we fiee. Unswerving still,

They near Laocoon ; and first enfold,

In snaky coiled embrace, the tiny limbs ι

Of his two sons, and gnaw their piteous flesh.

Him then with weapons running to their aid

They seize, and swathe him in hugh spires, and twice

' Fold in their scales his waist, and twice his throat,
And lift above him head and towering necks.

He strains his hands the while to burst those knots‚
His chaplets sprent with gore and venom black,
And with such roars of anguish fills the sky

. As when a wounded bull shakes from his neck
