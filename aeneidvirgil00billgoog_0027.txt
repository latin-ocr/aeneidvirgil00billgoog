“What pride of ancestry hath swoll'n you thus,
That heaven and earth you now confound‚ and raise
Turmoil so wild, ye Winds‚ without my will?
Whom I—but first to smooth the troubled waves. 13 ς
Not thus again shall you atone your deeds 1
Speed instant back! and tell your King, not his
The Sea's dominion and the Trident stern,
But mine by lot. The craggy halls are his,
Eurus, where ye are lodged : there let him vaunt,
There let him reign, with all his Winds immured !”

More swift than speech, he calms the swollen flood,
Chases the gathered clouds, brings back the sun.
Cymothoe and Triton, from the rock
Thrust off the ships, by his own trident raised ;
He channels the great Sands, the water smoothes,
And skims with printless wheels the level sea.

As when in some great concourse often springs

A tumult, and the rabble herd grow hereo,

Till stones and torches fly, the arms of rage,-

If then a man revered for worth and work

Face them, they listen, hush‘d, with straining ears ;
He governs them with words, and cools their heat.
So fell all Ocean's uproar, since the Sire

Looked o'er his waves, and gave his team the'rein,
Speeding in cloudless blue his easy car.

The o'erlaboured Trojans, straining now to gain
What coast lies nearest, turn to Libya’s shore.
There lies a haven in a creek retired,

Made by an island's arms, on which the sea
· Breaks, and deep inlets hold the parted wave.
On either hand two peaks of towering rock
·- Menace the sky, and underneath wide-spread
Sleeps the safe pool, o'er which a scene impends
