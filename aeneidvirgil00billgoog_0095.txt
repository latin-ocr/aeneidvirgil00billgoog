Treads on a snake unseen, and shuddering shrinks 380
From the blue neck puffed out, and rising hate 3
So, scared at us, Androgeus turned to flee.
We charge; we gird thern with a hedge of steel,
And strew thern broadcast, strangers to the ground,
And panic-struck. Fate speeds our first assay. 385
Then, flushed by victory, bold Coroebus eries τ
‘Come, folloW, friends, where F ortune early points
The way to safety, where she shows us grace l
Shields let us change, and gird Greek harness on.
Courage or craft, who ask which foemen use? 390
They, they shall arm us 1‘
Saying thus, he dons
Androgeus' plumy helm, and blazoned targe,
And fastens to his side an Argive brand.
Rhipeus and Dymas, all the troop, with glee
Do likewise, arming from our spoils new-won. 39 ς

“ Mingling with Greeks, by favour not our own,

Through the blind night we press, in many a fray

Closing, and many a Greek to Orcus send.

Some to the ships escape, and running seek

The trusty shore: some in base panic climb 400
The Horse, and hide in that familiar vault.

“Against God's Will, alas! all faith is vain!
Lo l Priam’s daughter with dishevelled hair,
Cassandra, dragged from Pallas' sacred shrines,
Vainly to heaven uplifts her burning eyes,- 40 5
Her eyes, for bonds her tender hands restrain.
That sight Coroebus bore not, mad with rage,
But flung himself amid the deep array‚
Deathdoomed. We follow, close our ranks, and charge.
But Trojan missiles from the temple’s roof 410
O'erwhelm us now: a wretched carnage springs
