Will try to meet her in her softest hour,
And tell when chance is kind. Then all with joy
Speed to obey his bidding.
But the Queen- 295
Who can deceive a lover ?-she foreknew
His guile, and early caught the coming stir.
She fears when allis safe3 and hears distraught
The same cold Rumour tell of launching ships.
Helpless she storms, and through the streets incensed 300
Raves like a Thyad, stirred by holy din,
Whom the trienriial orgies of the God
Madden‚ and all night through Cithaeron shouts.

Not thee our love, not thee thine hand once given
Restrains, nor Dido doomed to death and woe.
Nay even under winter's star thou strivest
To launch th ships and stem the northern gales. 310

No alien land, if ancient Troy remained,
„Would Troy be sought across this blustering sea t
Me 'dost thou flyt O, by these tears, Ι pray,
By thine own hand-for I have left but these— i 315
