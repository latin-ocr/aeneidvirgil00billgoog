Thy very foe would give the Trojans praise,
And boast himself of Teucer's ancient stock.
Ο come, then, Sirs‚ pass underneath our roof.
Me too like fortune through a world of woe

Hath tossed‚ and in this land late rest hath given.

To grief not strange, Ι leam to aid distress.''

She ended, and Aeneas led within
The regal halls, ordaining sacrifice.
And to his comrades on the beach meantime
Sends twenty bulls, an hundred bristled swine,

An hundred fatling lambs, their dams beside,
And joy the Wine God brings.

But in the centre of the Palace hall
A princely feast was set, where broidered cloths
01 royal purple on the boards were spread,
And massive silver; and brave deeds of yore
Shone, graved in gold, the legendary tale
01 all its heroes since the race began.

Aeneas, since a father’s love admits
No respite‚ to the ships Achates sends,
Ascanius to inform and thither guide,
Ascanius, the centre of all his care.
Gifts too he bids him bring, from Ilium’s sack
Rescued, a mantle stiff with gold inwrought,
A veil with crocus-hued acanthus flowers
Bordered‚ which Argive Helen erst had brought
Out from Mycenae, when she carne to Troy
And unpermitted love, her mother's gift ;
The sceptre also which Ilione,
Eldest of Priam's daughters, bore of old,
’ Necklet of pearl, and jewell'd golden tiar.
Hasting for these Achates seeks the ships.
