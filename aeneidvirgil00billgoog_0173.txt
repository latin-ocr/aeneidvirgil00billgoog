Help passion’s slave? The flame rs biting deep
E'en then, and dumb within the wound lives on.
Unhappy Dido, burning, through the town

Roams frenzied, like an arrow- stricken doe, η
Whom shooting far some hind1n Cretan glens ἄμμ
Carelessly struck, and left the flying steel
Unknowing. She' oer Dicte’s forest lawns

F hes, bearing rn her flank the reed of death.

Now through the streets she leads him, and displays
Her Tyrian wealth, her city built and made ;
Begins to speak, and checks the half-spoken word:
Now to the banquet goes at ebbing day,

And asks again to hear the Tale of Troy,
Infatuate. ¹ and again hangs on his lips

But when they part, and the dim moon in turn
Sets, and the sinking stars are urgihg sleep,
Sole 1n her halls she mourns, his empty couch
Clasps, and him absent hears far off and sees.
Or, by his father’s looks entranced, she hugs
Iulus, to beguile her uritold love.

No more the towers rise; no more the youth
Exercise arms, nor ports or bulwarks make

, Defensive: interrupted hang the works, ,
The giant threatening walls and engines huge.

‘ Her thus infected when the Wife of Jove
Saw, and to passion yielding up ¹her fame,
To Venus thus she spake· “A noble prize, ψ
An ample spoil ye win, a glorious name,
Thou and thy Boy! One woman by two Gods
Subtly subdued! Nor do Ι fail to see v
Our town thou fearest, this high‘Punic House
Holding suspect. But what shall be the end? ω

What boots our rivalryi Nay, let us make
